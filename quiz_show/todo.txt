1. Add player(s) to a game and the model?
    - need to keep score
    - begin with session player_1 (maybe player 2)
    - also session score_1
    - button click adds points and returns to gameboard
        - maybe a "no score" button to return for wrong answer
    - question played/not_played changes appearance and link
        - new game resets all to not_played

2. Deletes need an alert to verify choice
    - AJAX event?
